# Code Snippets Library

Reusable code pieces organized by language/framework.

## Organization
- `{language}-{purpose}.{extension}`
- Example: `javascript-debounce-function.js`

## Using Snippets
- Reference in project code with comment: `// Based on /knowledge/snippets/{filename}`
- Adapt to project needs
- Update snippet if you improve it
