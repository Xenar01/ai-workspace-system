When you want to start learning a new technology, copy and paste this prompt to Claude Code:

Create a new learning topic structure for "{TOPIC_NAME}":

1. Create folders:
   - Learning/{TOPIC_NAME}/
   - Learning/{TOPIC_NAME}/experiments/
   - Learning/{TOPIC_NAME}/notes/
   - Learning/{TOPIC_NAME}/.session-notes/

2. Copy the template from Learning/templates/learning-context-template.md
   to Learning/{TOPIC_NAME}/.context.md

3. In the new .context.md file:
   - Replace all {TOPIC_NAME} with the actual topic name
   - Add 3-5 specific learning goals for this topic
   - Add official documentation URL
   - Set "Started" date to today
   - Set "Current Phase" to "Getting Started"

4. Show me the created structure and the customized .context.md

**Instructions:**
1. Replace {TOPIC_NAME} with your new topic (e.g., "docker", "typescript", "supabase")
2. After creation, update the learning goals to be specific to what you want to learn
3. Add any known resources or documentation links

**Examples:**
- Learning/{TOPIC_NAME}/ becomes Learning/docker/
- Learning/{TOPIC_NAME}/ becomes Learning/typescript/
- Learning/{TOPIC_NAME}/ becomes Learning/supabase/
