## For Projects (Development Work)

Run the end-of-session checklist and show me what you plan to update BEFORE making changes:

1. UPDATE .context.md:
   - Add today's accomplishments to "Current Focus"
   - Document any new decisions under "Key Decisions" with WHY
   - Update "Next Steps"
   - Add "Last updated" timestamp with today's date

2. CREATE/UPDATE SESSION NOTE:
   - File: .session-notes/[TODAY'S DATE].md
   - Include: goals, what was done, decisions made, next steps, any blockers
   - Use the template from /Projects/templates/session-note-template.md

3. ORGANIZE FILES:
   - Any reusable code → suggest moving to /knowledge/snippets/
   - Any new patterns/guides → suggest moving to /knowledge/guides/
   - List any temporary files in /sandbox/ that should be kept or deleted

4. UPDATE SHARED KNOWLEDGE (if applicable):
   - If decisions affect multiple projects → update /knowledge/shared-decisions.md
   - Suggest adding references in related .context.md files

5. SUMMARY:
   - What we accomplished today
   - What's next
   - Any action items for me

Show me everything you'll update, then ask for my approval before making changes.
